                    Everything was interesting to her. She knew nothing. I knew everythingâ€¦been there, done that. She
                    was in the moment, I was in the past. She was mindful. I was mindless.</p>

                    discomfort in the future. The same is true as we experience the emotional sensation of stress from
                    our first instances of social rejection or ridicule. We quickly learn to fear and thus automatically
                    avoid potentially stressful situations of all kinds, including the most common of all: making
                    mistakes.</p>
